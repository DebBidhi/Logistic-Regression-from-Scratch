# Classification using Logistic Regression from Scratch (without Neural Network)

## Project Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model from scratch to classify images as cars or non-cars using Python and NumPy, without using deep neural networks.

## Model Visualization

### Model's Car Perception

this is what my model's reconstruction of its learned parameters of what is a car!

## Key Features
- Built entirely using NumPy
- Implemented core logistic regression components from scratch
- Image preprocessing and feature extraction
- Hyperparameter tuning with learning rate analysis
- Model performance visualization

## Dataset
- Car and non-car images from Kaggle's Car Non-Car dataset
- Image size: 72x72 pixels
- Preprocessed and normalized for training

## Technical Implementation
- Sigmoid activation function
- Gradient descent optimization
- Binary classification with 0.5 threshold

## Model Performance
- Training Accuracy: 99%
- Testing Accuracy: 93-97%
